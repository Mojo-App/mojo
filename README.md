# Mojo Music

Mojo is an audio/media streaming platform that empowers artists and content creators through web3 and blockchain technologies.

The Mojo web3 application allows users to upload their valuable digital assets easily and seamlessly to the IPFS Network via our user interface. Files cannot get deleted, hacked, edited, stolen and are never saved to a server making them truly decentralised.

Creators can finally mint NFTs for music and sound tracks and customize the metadata attributes based on the media type. Creators will be able to manage their Mojo Music NFTs using Tableland's relational metadata protocol for EVM chains. This freedom allows you to update non-essential data, yet keeping the true values of the non-fungible token in tack and aligned with core NFT values and standards.

Music platforms and streaming is not new technology. However, IPFS is still new enough that streaming is not yet native to its content delivery. IPFS is a wonderful technology as it allows for content ownership, portability, and verifiability. It powers NFT marketplaces, individual websites, file-sharing platforms, and so much more.

However, IPFS, the protocol, does not have a responsibility to match the experience of traditional cloud file services. Instead, that responsibility falls onto the shoulders of the IPFS adopters.

Mojo helps fill this gap and gives musicians, artists and all content creators an opportunity to broaden their social reach by offering specially crafted audio and media NFTs that allow their followers and subscribers to access bonus content and features. This can include airdrops, bonus videos or written content for example.

Mojo aims to further it's product by building the following key features in web3 application:

1. Artists should be able to upload their content in a secure and friendly manner.
2. Listeners/viewers should be able to view music streams on the platform free of charge
3. The platform should offer cryptocurrency-based payments to artists and their audiences.
4. Music fans should have full access to their favorite artists with bonus content and features.
5. Upon the purchase of a NFT, smart contracts should automatically process payments of royalty fees to digital artists and content creators.
6. The platform should use blockchain to keep transactions and accounting transparent.
7. The platform should let the artists keep most of the revenue they generate with very small fees to maintain the Mojo geek-o-system.
8. Listeners/viewers shouldn‚Äôt have to contend with tacky ads. The platform should consider other monetization options,
   For e.g., artists can set up an agreement with their fans to share revenue if fans share music, helping it to reach a wider audience.
   NFT based content, artist can offer content to holders using Pinata's Submarine
   Establish a very high standard of niche advertising to followers
9. A simple user interface (UI) is important.
10. A defi element should be added to our token contracts to allow staking of NFTs

## Technology Stack

Mojo was built with or uses the following technologies in it's software life cycle:

Etheruem (Solidity) - Smart contracts written in Solidity

### Tableland

Tableland is a web3-native database that can be used to store data in relational tables. One of the most exciting use cases is using Tableland for NFT metadata ‚Äî which is a challenging problem in web3, especially for novel dynamic NFT use cases. Developers must make tradeoffs between:

1. Expensive on-chain storage with very limited query-ability
2. Centralized storage, which doesn‚Äôt enable web3 paradigms
3. Decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS), which is great for file/image storage, but immutable files (CIDs) pose a challenge for novel NFT metadata use cases

Tableland solves the web3 metadata problem with ERC721-based tables that are powered by smart contracts. Create, insert, and update tables, all using smart contracts and/or libraries built on top of Tableland smart contracts. The metadata can also be dynamic and change based on user interactions or on-chain events. The Tableland contracts are currently deployed on Polygon mainnet & Mumbai testnet, as well as a number of other chains with more coming soon.

Tableland Examples

```shell
https://testnet.tableland.network/query?mode=list&s=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20mojo_80001_1199
```

```shell
https://testnet.tableland.network/query?s=SELECT%20%27id%27,id,%27external_link%27,external_link%20FROM%20mojo_80001_1199%20WHERE%20id%3D1
```

### NFTPort Enhanced APIs ü¶∏üèª

NFTPort provide core products which make the developer experience as easy as possible and accelerate NFT application development. All of them enable to focus on building the best product for your users, instead of reinventing the NFT infrastructure wheel.

NFTPort provide enhanced APIs for Text Search so you don't have to build your own NFT database, Content NFTID which enables to find similar and duplicate NFTs to increase customer loyalty and an NFT Recommendation Engine to increase revenue.

### IPFS, Filecoin and NFT.Storage

The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized file system for building the next generation of the internet. Filecoin (opens new window) and many popular Web3 projects are built on IPFS. Some call it the hard drive for blockchain and Web3, though its power extends much further.

NFT.Storage is a long-term storage service designed for off-chain NFT data (like metadata, images, and other assets). Data is content addressed using IPFS, meaning the URI pointing to a piece of data (‚Äúipfs://‚Ä¶‚Äù) is completely unique to that data (using a content identifier, or CID). IPFS URLs and CIDs can be used in NFTs and metadata to ensure the NFT forever actually refers to the intended data (eliminating things like rug pulls, and making it trustlessly verifiable what content an NFT is associated with).
