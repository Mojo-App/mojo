# Mojo
Mojo is an audio/media streaming platform that empowers artists and creators through web3 and blockchain technologies.

The Mojo web application allows you to upload your valuable digital assets to the IPFS Network. Files cannot be deleted, hacked, edited, stolen and are never saved to any server making them 100% decentralised. Mojo allows creators to broaden their social reach offering custom NFTs that allow their followers and subscribers and access special content and features.

Streaming is not a new technology. However, IPFS is new enough that streaming is not yet native to its content delivery.

IPFS is a wonderful technology. It allows for content ownership, portability, and verifiability. It powers NFT marketplaces, individual websites, file-sharing platforms, and more. However, IPFS, the protocol, does not have a responsibility to match the experience of traditional cloud file services. Instead, that responsibility falls onto the shoulders of IPFS’s adoptors.

And that’s exactly why Pinata is releasing streaming video through their Dedicated Gateways.

With streaming video in place, those who visit your gateway will no longer have to wait for a video file to download fully before it can be played. Just visit the URL and the video will start streaming, just like you would expect with Netflix or Youtube.
